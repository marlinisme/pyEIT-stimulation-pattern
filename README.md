Download and install PyEIT first. 

In this code, we provide:
1) Adjacent protocol (adjacent excitation and adjacent measurement)
2) Adjacent with skip protocol (adjacent excitation with skip 3 electrodes)
3) Opposite protocol with adjacent measurement pair 
4) Opposite protocol with opposite measurement pair
5) Quasi-adjacent protocol (Baidillah, et al, IEEE SENSORS 2017)
